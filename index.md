# I'm Mariel Chua!
## Welcome to my user page!

I'm a third year student at UCSD studying [Computer Science](https://marielchua.github.io/GitHub-Pages/#why-i-chose-cs)! I'm using this page as my practice with Markdown.
Besides that, I'm also on a dance team here at UCSD called [Ascension](https://marielchua.github.io/GitHub-Pages/#about-my-dance-team), and I have a [job](https://marielchua.github.io/GitHub-Pages/#about-my-job) on campus.

> I hope to have a lot of fun and learn a lot in this class! I'm very excited to meet my group :)

Dis is me:
```
if(stressed()){
    stopStress();
    playKirbyGame();
}
```
## Why I Chose CS
I hope to go into game development one day with my CS career, since I really like [videogames](https://marielchua.github.io/GitHub-Pages/#video-games-i-like) (I recently have been really liking [Kirby](https://youtu.be/XBvRzwXxzSQ) and FFXIV!). However, I also just want any job that lets me be a part of programming interesting and useful things. 
I started programming in high school (which seems pretty late compared to the other people in my major). I learned these languages in this order:
1. Java
2. C
3. Python
4. C++, Currently, I'm trying to teach myself C# as well :)

## Goals for this Class
- [x] Get a cool professor :3
- [ ] Meet my groupmates!
- [ ] Learn about today's culture surrounding software engineering
- [ ] Create a project I can put on my resume

## More about me besides CS
### [About my dance team](https://youtu.be/Yd4yXcT6r1I)
I've been on **Ascension** for two years, going into my third. It gives me a good break from the stress of school, and I've actually met a lot of other CSE majors in the dance community! Click on the section title to see our competitive set in 2021!

### About my job
I just work a part time job in the **Receiving Dept** for UCSD! Honestly, it's not very interesting work, but I do end up talking about my major with my supervisors a lot since they're really supportive of their students.

### Video games I like
Since video games are what got me interested in CS in the first place, I'll list out some of my favorites/ones I'm currently playing here.
* FFXIV
* Kirby the Forgotten Land
* Fire Emblem Three Houses
* FFXII *Zodiac Age*
* Valorant (***I'M DOGWATER THOUGH***)
